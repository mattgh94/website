## Matts Website

This is a basic blog built with html, scss, gulp and javascript
integrated with gRPC web, proxy server and go microservice (armeria) backend (yes it's overkill but fun!)

Run npm install to install modules
Run gulp to compile and watch changes for scss files. CSS and javascript files are stored in the dist folder
